# landing_page

This the landing page project from the end of the CSS section of the Odin project.
Here I will be be recreating a landing page from scratch given just an image as reference, creating the HTML and CSS from scratch.
This project will demonstrate the totality of what I have learned so far, from the basics of HTML, and CSS, with a specific focus on layout and the use of flex in CSS
